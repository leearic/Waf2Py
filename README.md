## Compiled version
You can download a compiled version, the bundle contains a compiled version of nginx and modsecurity in a debian 10 system, also contains a copy a of web2py framework with waf2py app loaded, and a script which install some dependences and put everything in his place.
you can find this in the releases section: https://github.com/ITSec-Chile/Waf2Py/releases



## Installation steps


```
git clone https://github.com/ITSec-Chile/Waf2Py
cd Waf2Py/installer/
su root
chmod +x waf2py_installer.sh
#the following script will download and compile the components needed.
./waf2py_installer.sh
```

After the installation you need to run the command "crontab -e" as "root", select an editor and save the file without making any change. 
waf2py need crontajobs but they will are not active until  **crontab: installing new crontab** message is returned.

Example:
```
root@debian:/home/chris# crontab -e
Select an editor.  To change later, run 'select-editor'.
  1. /bin/nano        <---- easiest
  2. /usr/bin/vim.tiny

Choose 1-2 [1]: 1
**crontab: installing new crontab**
```


once is installed go to:
```
https://your_server_ip:62443
Login:
admin:admin (don't forget to change this password!, also you should check the apache conf and look for the /admin and /appadmin path and restrict them to loclahost or trusted IPs)
next step:
go to system --> manage engine --> start engine (this will start nginx, then you can add an application)
```

## Status box explanation
```
Not Running = Nginx not running
Running but 0 apps running = Nginx running but no web app created
Nginx running and apps running = Nginx is running an there is at least 1 web app running
```

## Creating a website
```
1 - Create a virtual IP
      --> Interfaces menu

2 - Create a new app
      --> Click "Deploy" button

3 - Configure the new app
      --> Websites running menu
      --> Click over the application
      --> Configure the backend
      --> Configure ports (leave it blank if you dont need https ports, same thing apply to http ports)
      --> Configure certificates if ssl ports are set
      --> Choose a virtual ip (previusly created on Interfaces menu)
      --> Press the "play" button to enable the new app
      --> Done.
```
## Cronjobs
- There is a cronjob used to restore the virtual interface and bring up nginx when on every reboot
- There is a cronjob to update the dashboard stadistics every 5 minutes
- There is a cronjob for log rotation every night. Rotated logs are available under "Download logs" tab.
